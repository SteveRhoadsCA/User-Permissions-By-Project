User Permissions By Project App
================================

These apps display User Project Permissions for Project Admins and Users, respecting the Project Tree Hierarchy as the project of reference.  The only difference is that one version allows you to see disabled users, while the other only queries active users.

This app does scope down from the selected project to show rights in the projects below it.
